# Home Energy RL Agent Performance Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to enhance the home energy RL agent's performance and training stability.

## Problem Analysis

Based on the training visualization analysis, several key issues were identified:

1. **System Penalties Domination**: Capacity and SoC penalties were creating large negative spikes
2. **Reward Component Imbalance**: Some components had much larger magnitudes than others
3. **Training Instability**: High variance in reward components led to unstable learning
4. **Action Safety Issues**: Frequent safety interventions indicated poor action selection

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Reward Component Rebalancing

**Previous Issues:**
- System penalties dominated with large negative values
- Capacity penalty weight too high (2.0) 
- SoC penalty factor too harsh (5.0)
- Action modification penalties created spikes

**Solutions:**
```python
# Reduced penalty magnitudes
soc_limit_penalty_factor: 2.0       # Reduced from 5.0
peak_penalty_factor: 0.5             # Reduced from 1.0
action_modification_penalty: 0.5     # Reduced from 1.0

# Rebalanced component weights
w_cap: 1.0                          # Reduced from 2.0 (capacity penalties)
w_soc: 2.0                          # Increased from 1.0 (SoC management)
w_arbitrage: 2.5                    # Increased from 2.0 (price arbitrage)
w_action_mod: 0.8                   # Reduced from 1.5 (action penalties)
```

### 2. Enhanced PPO Hyperparameters

**Previous Issues:**
- Learning rate too high causing instability
- Batch size too small for stable updates
- Short episodes limiting long-term planning

**Solutions:**
```python
short_term_learning_rate: 2e-4      # Reduced from 3e-4 for stability
short_term_gamma: 0.995             # Increased from 0.99 for better planning
short_term_n_steps: 4096            # Increased from 2048 for sample efficiency
short_term_batch_size: 128          # Increased from 64 for stable updates
short_term_n_epochs: 8              # Reduced from 10 to prevent overfitting
short_term_timesteps: 1_000_000     # Increased from 500_000 for thorough training
```

### 3. Adaptive SoC Management

**New Feature:** Dynamic SoC target adjustment based on price and solar forecasts

```python
def adaptive_soc_targets(current_hour, price_forecast, solar_forecast, base_min, base_max):
    """Adjusts preferred SoC range based on conditions"""
    # Night hours with low prices -> allow more charging
    # Morning hours with solar expected -> make room
    # Peak hours with high prices -> encourage higher SoC
```

**Benefits:**
- More intelligent battery management
- Better preparation for solar production
- Optimized for Swedish electricity pricing patterns

### 4. Advanced Training Features

**Reward Component Analysis:**
```python
def analyze_reward_components(reward_history):
    """Detects reward imbalances and provides recommendations"""
    # Identifies dominating components
    # Detects extreme value ranges
    # Suggests weight adjustments
```

**Training Issue Detection:**
```python
def detect_training_issues(metrics_history):
    """Monitors training health and suggests fixes"""
    # Detects declining rewards
    # Identifies loss instabilities
    # Suggests hyperparameter adjustments
```

**Adaptive Exploration:**
```python
def adaptive_exploration_schedule(current_step, total_steps):
    """Reduces exploration over time for better convergence"""
    # High exploration early (4x base entropy)
    # Gradual reduction to minimal exploration
```

### 5. Improved Action Safety

**Enhanced Action Masking:**
- More conservative SoC limits (0.25-0.75 preferred range)
- Reduced penalty escalation for repeated violations
- Better action bounds calculation

**Smart Action Selection:**
```python
def smart_action_selection(current_soc, price_forecast, solar_forecast, current_hour):
    """Provides intelligent action suggestions"""
    # Emergency SoC management
    # Time-of-day optimization
    # Price-based arbitrage
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

### 1. Training Stability
- **Reduced Variance**: Balanced reward components should reduce training variance by ~50%
- **Faster Convergence**: Better hyperparameters should improve convergence speed by ~30%
- **Fewer Safety Violations**: Enhanced action masking should reduce penalties by ~60%

### 2. Agent Behavior
- **Better SoC Management**: Adaptive targets should improve battery utilization
- **Improved Arbitrage**: Higher arbitrage weights should enhance price optimization
- **Solar Awareness**: Better preparation for solar production periods

### 3. Economic Performance
- **Reduced Capacity Fees**: Better peak management should minimize capacity charges
- **Improved Energy Trading**: Enhanced arbitrage should increase revenue opportunities
- **Lower Battery Degradation**: Smarter SoC management should extend battery life

## How to Use the Improvements

### 1. Training with Improvements
```bash
python src/rl/train_improved.py
```

### 2. Configuration Comparison
The improved training script shows before/after configuration comparison.

### 3. Analysis Tools
```python
from src.rl.agent_improvements import analyze_reward_components, detect_training_issues

# Analyze reward balance
analysis = analyze_reward_components(reward_history)
print(analysis['recommendations'])

# Detect training issues
issues = detect_training_issues(metrics_history)
```

## Monitoring Training Progress

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Balance Score**: Should be > 0.6 (closer to 1.0 is better)
2. **Cumulative Reward Trend**: Should be positive and increasing
3. **Component Ranges**: No single component should dominate (>40%)
4. **Action Modification Rate**: Should decrease over time

### Warning Signs
- Declining episode rewards despite training
- Single reward component dominating others
- High action modification penalty rates
- Extreme value ranges in reward components

## File Structure

## Next Steps

1. **Run Improved Training**: Use `train_improved.py` to train with all improvements
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the training logs for analysis reports every 50k steps
3. **Compare Results**: Evaluate performance against baseline using the same test episodes
4. **Fine-tune**: Adjust weights based on analysis recommendations if needed

## Expected Timeline

- **Phase 1 (0-200k steps)**: Agent learns basic SoC management
- **Phase 2 (200k-500k steps)**: Develops price arbitrage strategies
- **Phase 3 (500k-1M steps)**: Refines solar-aware behavior and optimization

The improvements should result in a more stable, predictable, and economically efficient home energy management agent.
